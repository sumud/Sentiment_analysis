# Sentiment_analysis

Here we worked on sentiment analysis using R on tidy format data. 
We woorked on Jane Austen's 6 novels and analyzed the sentiment of sections of the novels as positive or negative.
Among the various methods and dictionaries available for evaluating the sentiment of a text, we used: bing and nrc
sentiment lexicons. 
These are based on unigrams. The bing lexicon assigns positive/negative sentiment to the words. The nrc lexicon categorizes 
words in yes/no into multiple sentiments: joy, surprise, positive, negative etc.

When we use tidy format data, we can perform sentiment analysis using inner_join.
